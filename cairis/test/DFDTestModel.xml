<tvtypes>
<vulnerability_type name="Configuration" >
  <description>A vulnerability resulting from an error in the configuration and administration of a system or component.</description>
</vulnerability_type>
<vulnerability_type name="Design" >
  <description>A vulnerability inherent in the design or specification of hardware or software whereby even a perfect implementation will result in a vulnerability.</description>
</vulnerability_type>
<vulnerability_type name="Implementation" >
  <description>A vulnerability resulting from an error made in implementing software or hardware of a satisfactory design.</description>
</vulnerability_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/DoS and DDoS" >
  <description>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack involves a malicious attempt to disrupt the operation of a computer system or network that is connected to the Internet.  A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a more dangerous evolution of a DoS attack because it utilises a network of compromised zombie computers to mount the attack, so there is no identifiable single source.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Hacking" >
  <description>Hackers want to get into your computer system and use them for their own purposes.  There are many hacking tools available on the internet as well as online communities actively discussing hacking techniques enabling even unskilled hackers to break into unprotected systems.  Hackers have a range of motives; from showing off their technical prowess, to theft of money, credentials or information, to cause damage.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Keystroke logging" >
  <description>Keystroke loggers work by recording the sequence of key-strokes that a user types in.  The more sophisticated versions use filtering mechanisms to only record highly prized information such as email addresses, passwords and credit card number sequences.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Malware" >
  <description>Malware is any program or file that is harmful to a computer, the term covers viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware.  Malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated and can be used to compromise computers to install DOS zombie programs or other malicious programs.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Phishing and Spoofing" >
  <description>Phishing describes a social engineering process designed to trick an organisation's customers into imparting confidential information such as passwords, personal data or banking and financial details.  Most commonly these are criminal attacks but the same techniques could be used by others to get sensitive information.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Insider/Manipulation" >
  <description>Sometimes deliberate attempts are made to acquire information or access by manipulating staff by using a range of influencing techniques.  This is sometimes described as social engineering, creating situations in which someone will willingly provide access to information, sites or systems to someone unauthorised to receive it.  Customer facing personnel who have been trained to be helpful and informative can be particularly vulnerable to such attacks.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Insider/Sabotage" >
  <description>Saborage is often committed by a former employee seeking revenge on their employer because of a personal grudge caused by a negative work related event such as dismissal.  Although it is sometimes planned well in advance, it can also be the result of an opportunistic moment.</description>

<project_settings name="NeuroGrid data transfer" >
  <background>NeuroGrid is a project funded by the UK Medical Research Council.  The project's aim is to develop a Grid-based collaborative research environment, in order to enhance collaboration both within and between clinical researchers.

The sensitivity of this clinical data and its distributed nature drives the need to find secure and effective ways of accessing and managing it.</background>
  <strategic_goals>The high-level goal which needs to be satisfied is the secure processing of clinical data.  This involves securely uploading clinical data to NeuroGrid, which is then analysed before aggregated results can be downloaded.</strategic_goals>
  <rich_picture image="" />
  <scope>The scope of this study is restricted to the upload and download of data to and from NeuroGrid.</scope>

  <definition>This exemplar aims to improve infrastructure for handling imaging in large studies including:

- efficient interpretation and storage of large image datasets from multicentre randomised controlled trials,
- very large studies of observer reliability to improve image interpretation,
- establishing large living archives of images linked to key metadata for diseases which require long term study to understand their true nature history and the effects of treatment, and
- for knowledge transfer.

The development of a structure for trial image metadata, based on a careful description of the metadata in the two exemplar trials is a key part of the project.</definition>

    <narrative>Carol gained access to the Computing Laboratory by tail-gating one of the many new DTC students arriving that day.  When she reached the attrium she asked a nearby porter for directions to the Neurosciences areas.  Carol followed the directions and eventually reached an open-plan area with a number of PCs.  The computer room is a shared work area used by the many post-docs working in the department.  Carol espied an unused PC, next to which was a man in his mid-20s who appeared to be deeply engrossed in his work. Carol approached the main and attempted to get his attention.  "Hi there", Carol said, "I'm Carol, and I'm a new post-doc in the group".  Dave looked up from his PC and smiled.  "Hi", said the over-worked post-doc, "I'm Dave.  Due mentioned something about a new post-doc.  Well, I see you found your way here ok.".  "Eventually", said Carol, "Oxford is a bit of a tardis isn't it.  Is this desk free?".  "Sure, make yourself at home", replied Dave.  Carol sat down and pulled an A4 pad and some dog-eared papers from the day-sac she had been carrying around; she wanted to give the impression she was annotating some academic papers.  

After about 30 minutes, Dave sat back from his PC and sighed.  Noticing this, and sensing  an opportunity, Carol asked "Is there anywhere we can get a coffee around here?"  "You must have been reading my mind", Dave said, "Taylors is pretty good, which I'm just on my way to now - do you want to come?".

On the way to the coffee shop, Carol gave her cover story to Dave.  She was a new post-doc who had started today, but her new supervisor was away that week, she was told to just "get on with stuff" until he returned from leave.  She was obviously a bit frustrated though, as she had no login details and couldn't download any of her supervisor's previous analysis from NeuroGrid.  "No problem", said Dave, "I'll just log you in when we get back, and I'll give you a copy of my NeuroGrid certificate on a USB stick".  On their return, Dave logged Carol into the guest PC and gave her the certificate as promised.  For the rest of the day, Carol surfed the web until about 7pm when Dave went home.  When she was sure the office was empty, Carol took out her camera and took several shots of the PC, with the login screen of the NeuroGrid portal clearly visible.  She then scribbled down the events of the day on her A4 pad before leaving the building to catch the Oxford Tube back to London.</narrative>

    <narrative>Yves knew for sometime that Sally had access to a data-set he needed to finish off a trial in time for that journal submission deadline.  However, due to administrative overhead of obtaining ethical approval, Yves never got around to applying for access to that data-set himself.  Besides, he was so busy doing research, where was he going to get the time to drop everything to fill in the necessary paperwork.  He, therefore, decide to progress his research and deal with getting the data he needed precisely when he needed it.

"Aaarrgghh" cried Yves.  "What's up", asked Sally from the other end of the open-plan office they shared.  "I'm missing several samples of data from that batch of images we got from the Phillipines last week", said Yves.
Sally came over and looking at the workflow results on Yves screen.  "Ah", said Sally, "I think the data is there but you just don't have access to it."  "What!" exclaimed Yves, "I was told I had everything I needed from Mike, why didn't he tell me I was missing images from this data set.  How am I supposed to submit this paper by the end of the week without a complete validation".  Yves put his head in his hands.

"You know what", said Sally, "I think I've got access to that data.  Why don't you just login as me and resubmit your workflow that way".  
Yves perked up; "Sally, you're a star", Yves said, "you've just earned yourself some drinks and a paper acknowledgement.".

Sally walked back to her desk, copied her digital certificate to a USB stick, before walking back to Yves to hand over the key.  "Ta", said Yves, before loading the digital certificate to his web-browser, logging back into NeuroGrid, and re-submitting his workflow. </narrative>

  <misusecase environment="Core Technology">
    <narrative>Several weeks ago, Mallory installed a rootkit on a PC in the UK which happened to be used to access NeuroGrid.  While examining the PC recently, Mallory noticed certain characteristics of the PC suggesting that this machine was being used to access a computational grid.

After setting up a packet sniffer to monitor traffic, Mallory spotted the potential for a replay attack which could be reproduced from several different machines.  Mallory subsequently wrote a script and ran it from a different machine using the same root certificate.  It worked!  Mallory now had a way of uploading workflows on demand to NeuroGrid - useful for any high-intensive processing needing to be carried out, such as breaking symmetric encryption.</narrative>

    <narrative>Alice was in a hurry.  She desparately had to catch that 10.15 train to London but she didn't have time to go all the way back to the Comlab to download the latest analysis results - results she needed for the presentation she was giving at UCL. As she crossed Hythe Bridge, Alice remembered that there was a cheap call shop near the chinese supermarket; perhaps they had internet access.  Alice hurried into the shop and noticed a bank of PCs by the far wall.  

After enquiring about the use of a PC, Alice was told it would be 5 pounds for 30 minutes use.  She only needed the machine for about 5 minutes but her need was urgent so she paid up and hurried over to the nearest PC.   Alice reached for her USB stick, transferred her root certificate to the machine, logged into the NeuroGrid portal, downloaded her results from her WebDav folder, before transferring them to his USB stick.  After glancing nervously at her watch, she pulled out his USB, closed the web-browser down and walked briskly out of the shop and towards the station.  Perhaps she might make that train after all.

Two hours later, and several hundred miles away, Mallory checked his bot herd status logs.  It looks like he was the proud owner of 10 new PCs.  Mallory ran the machine inventory script of his new prizes, and noticed that one of them had earlier access the NeuroGrid portal.  "Yes!" Mallory exclaimed to himself as he checked the browser cache and found an elusive digital certificate.  As Mallory transferred this certificate to his machine, ensuring afterwards it was removed from the newly owned PC at the internet cafe in Oxford, he could only wonder at the processing power now made available to him.</narrative>

<persona name="Claire" type="Primary" assumption_persona="FALSE" image="Claire.jpg" >
  <activities>Claire is a clinical researcher within the Psychosis exemplar.  She is responsible for a group which is developing and testing processing pipelines for harmonising MRI images from different centres.

Claire authorises requests that other members of her group make for accessing NeuroGrid, and is officially responsible for making sure her colleagues aren't misusing their access.  In practice, however, she delegates much of her responsibility to one of her more security-knowledgeable colleagues.</activities>
  <attitudes>Claire feels that NeuroGrid has a lot to offer her research but, right now, its hard to see the benefits for the usability problems she faces.

Although Claire appreciates the importance of security and the confidentialty of her research subjects, authorising colleague requests for data access and liasing with the infrastructure team is a time consuming process which isn't helping her get any research done. 

Claire is also perplexed at why security could cause simple workflows take such a long time to run, but she also remembers how long it used to take to get data before NeuroGrid so she can live with the performance issues.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Claire and her colleagues follow a set of processes and guidelines when working with data uploaded to NeuroGrid.

Because obtaining data is an expensive business, Claire also tries to reuse data and analysis as much as possible, and as far as her ethics clearance allows.  

</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Besides her research, Claire's primary security concerns are centered around the datasets she maintains, and making sure her colleagues and collaborators can access the data they need. </motivations>

<persona name="Tom" type="Primary" assumption_persona="FALSE" image="Tom.jpg" >
  <activities>Tom is an applications developer within the Stroke exemplar.  

Tom collaborates with a his clinical researchers colleagues as part of a number of on-going trials to support their research work.  This includes anonymises images, and uploads these to NeuroGrid.</activities>
  <attitudes>Tom is aware that some of his users find security painful, and he believes that a usable system will eventually lead to a secure system as well.  Having fielding questions from his users about NeuroGrid, Tom has found that when users understand why things are the way they are, NeuroGrid makes a bit more sense.

Tom is, however, aware that medical researchers sometimes have their rules about what should and shouldn't be secured which can be source of annoyance to him.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Nothing stipulated</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Tom feels responsible for making sure that users can't do anything damaging - either to their research or system security in general.

Tom also wants security to be practical.  Tom shares the infrastructure team's view on the importance of network security, and believes that, if left up to his users alone, that nothing will ever be agreed.  Consequently, Tom is happy to work with whatever security controls are mandated.</motivations>

  <activities>Matt is a system administrator on the infrastructure team.  In addition to maintaining the infrastructure, Matt and his team are responsible for securing the NeuroGrid infrastructure; this includes network security and software security on the NeuroGrid node machines.

Matt is also the designated NeuroGrid Certificate Authority and, as such, is often the first line for users in all exemplars if there are NeuroGrid access problems.  As the infrastructure team are also responsible for maintaining the NeuroGrid access control policies, Matt also helps data owners craft the fine grained policies controlling access to managed datasets.</activities>

  <excerpt>When you are working with medical data, if you have a security issue with medical data and it gets to the press, it can cause some major problems.  \\nJust from looking at historical cases, where members of the public have found things out they didn\\\'t like about themselves, their friends or their family, or even in just the way the data was used, or just the fact that somebody got access to the data.  \\nIt wouldn\\\'t even matter if they could do anything with the data, the fact that it can happen can cause the media to have an outcry, as this can sell papers.  \\nThat sort of thing can shut down projects fairly rapidly.  </excerpt>

  <excerpt>They obviously wanted their data to be secure and it was fairly high up in the list of priorities of people I spoke to.  \\nThis was particularly the case for psychosis, but that was understandable given that a lot of their patients had criminal records and other likely secondary problems.  \\nThere was a police involvement usually in their cases and there is a delicate area for funding.  \\nThey said at one point that if there was any problem with security, we could be quite sure that we wouldn\\\'t get access.  \\nEspecially as the legislation at the time involved sectioning of schizophrenics and things like this.  \\nThis was a serious concern for them.  </excerpt>

  <excerpt>in terms of our middleware - data transport, facilitating secure access, managing user credentials and that kind of stuff, we take this really seriously.  \\nThis has been the one great driver for us as a lot of grid middleware started out as being about computational grids, and managing workflows and jobs for physicists.  \\nIn e-DiaMoND, we came to the conclusion that the middleware wasn\\\'t fit for purpose and our focus has always been data and about data.  \\nThat is why we abandoned GT3 and did our own thing, as we have very clear requirements with respect to security and interoperability and all these other things.  </excerpt>

  <excerpt>One of the problems with universities is trying to transfer data between universities can be pretty difficult.  \\nSo, you\\\'ve got large amount of information, scans which take up gigabytes of information, and you have to try and transfer that.  \\nYou\\\'ve got the restrictions of what may or may not be suitable and then you\\\'ve got, in terms of technical limitations, how you can transfer data.  \\nYou then need to come up with methods that are secure, so if the data fell into someone else\\\'s hands then it wouldn\\\'t be useful for them.</excerpt>

  <excerpt>At the beginning, we were thinking that as an API user, username and password is much more common so maybe it would have been more automated if the people could use username and password on the portal and, based on that username and password, when we could recognise them, we could use a certificate for them internally.  </excerpt>

<document_reference name="Shortcuts taken to move data quicker." contributor="SF" document="Security erosion GT concept" >
  <excerpt> I think one of the problems when you\\\'ve got lots of universities and different institutions is that they all have their own frameworks and guidelines in place for managing data securely.  \\nI think that sometimes it would be much easier if there was a broad consensus if people did things in a similar way and there was an appreciation that data needs to be transferred between sites and this needs to be enabled more easily.  \\nI think one of the dangers is that short-cuts are taken as things are so difficult that people say well it\\\'s going to be too difficult to go through this entire process, we need the data more quickly.  \\nI don\\\'t think we\\\'ve had that, but I foresee that happening if there was real pressure.  \\nFor example, at one of the sites we did have a delay in getting started and it did get completed very quickly.  \\nHad it not then we could have run into problems trying to cut through red-tape in order to transfer data securely.  \\nYou can imagine a situation where someone says look we just need the data to do this so let\\\'s just take a short cut.  \\nI guess that sort of idea of collaboration given more consideration, so data can be transferred around more easily, with the necessary safeguards in place. </excerpt>

<document_reference name="Users are authorised by an exemplar sponsor." contributor="SF" document="Socialisation GT concept" >
  <excerpt>Normally, they will need sponsorship from one of the exemplars, there is Dementia, Stroke and Psychosis ; there is an investigator for each exemplar.  \\nSo, to begin with, they will need to be authorised by that person.  \\nAt that point, we can give them a certificate to access the system and we will probably discuss with the data owner any ramifications about what access they should have and that kind of thing.  \\nWe then give them a certificate and some instructions and they are on their way.</excerpt>

  <excerpt>Most of what we develop is designed to be used by technical people developing end-user applications.  \\nIt is not designed for end-users to use.  \\nSo, it is reasonable to expect that the people we are developing for has a certain amount of technical ability and to be able to understand how to use the APIs we provide and the sample code we gave them.</excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Guest certificates provided as obtaining personal certificates is too cumbersome." contributor="SF" document="Socialisation GT concept" >
  <excerpt>The reason we have the guest certificate is that the process of obtaining the personal certificate was very difficult as it involved you calling people in Oxford.  \\nThey send a certificate over email, but they don\\\'t send the password.  \\nYou have to call them, or you have to setup a secure email account. \\nIn both cases this is difficult.  \\nWe had people on the NeuroGrid project where, after a year or so, said \\\"we never go around to calling Douglas to get the password, so we lost the password and we don\\\'t know what it is\\\".  </excerpt>

<document_reference name="Specific steps are followed for anonymising data." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture norms GT concept" >
  <excerpt>The first part is can any data be exported at all.  \\nBehind the scene, all this imaging data is kept in a local archive and the people who manage the archive carry out preliminary steps to limit the amount of patient data that can be correlated to the images themselves.  \\nIt is hard to say what the DICOM files might contain, so you have to be fairly strict about getting rid of stuff, as there are all kinds of variation about format.  \\nOne file might contain a patient\\\'s name, or the physician\\\'s name, or the radiographer\\\'s name.  \\nSo, there is a preliminary step, which is done by the people who manage the archive.  \\nWhen it becomes time to actually export it from outside, to go outside our firewall, that is where I come in and that is where NeuroGrid is affected.  </excerpt>

<document_reference name="Data sensitive users refuse algorithmic workflow access." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture perception GT concept" >
  <excerpt>In NeuroGrid, they brought together three groups of people who had radically different views on security and different types of data.  \\nWe have one person whose data is all about potential schizophrenics.  \\nThat is very sensitive data as a lot of these people aren\\\'t schizophrenics but have a very high probability of becoming one.  \\nThat is bad information to get out into the field because of insurance issues or because people won\\\'t employ them.  \\nSo, his ethics are very strict to the extent that he never wanted his data to leave the server.  He would only allow processed results to leave.  \\nAs it turned out, the whole workflow side of the project never happened as you can\\\'t run an algorithm across his data, but he was really pushing for ultra-strict security where you would have to process the data to such an extent that it was useless for identification, whereas other people put data on the system and don\\\'t care who sees it.  \\nThe fact that it was a closed group of only 40 people, who would be happy to turn all the access control off if they could.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Security conscious users reluctant to provide access." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture perception GT concept" >
