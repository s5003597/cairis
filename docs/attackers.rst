Attackers
=========

Attackers launch attacks in the form of threats. Attackers are similar
to personas in that they fulfill one or more roles, and can be personalised
with additional information.

Certain capabilities and motivations may be associated with attackers.
CAIRIS is pre-loaded with a selection of these, but these can be
modified, or new capabilities and motivations created by selecting the
Options/Capabilities or Options/Motivations menu options.
