Locations
=========

A Locations object is a collection of *location* objects connected by *links*.  A location could be anything ranging from a room, corridor, or even a building.
Within a *location* it is possible to specify instances of assets or personas.
CAIRIS makes it possible to overlay risks onto location models, to explore the impact security might have on a physical location.
