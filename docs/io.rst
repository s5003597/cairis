Importing and Exporting models
==============================

Importing models
----------------

You can import models by selecting the System / Import Model menu, selecting the model type to import, and the model file itself.

You will usually want to stick with the Model Package option to import .cairis files.  .cairis files are zip archives with a model file, any supplemental locations and architectural pattern models, and all the image files associated with the model.  

You can, alternatively, select the Model option, which imports a standard CAIRIS XML model file (as defined by the DTD in https://cairis.org/dtd/cairis_model.dtd).  If you select this option, you can choose to overwrite an existing model (the default option) or you can incrementally import the contents of a model file into a pre-existing model.  

You can also import other types of model into your current working project.

If you have command line access to the server running the CAIRIS server then a quicker way of importing a model is to use the cimport.py script, which can be found in cairis/cairis/bin.  The below command, which is run from cairis/cairis/bin, imports the ACME Water sample model into the default database of the test user. 

.. code-block:: bash

   ./cimport.py --user=test --database=test_default --type all --overwrite 1 ../../examples/exemplars/ACME_Water/ACME_Water.xml

Running cimport.py with the --help argument provides more detailed import options.

Exporting models
----------------

.. figure:: ExportModel.jpg
   :alt: export model form

To export a model, select the System / Export Model option.  Exporting the current model renders the current CAIRIS database you are working with as a CAIRIS XML model (conforming to cairis_model.dtd).
You can also export a selected architectural pattern, the security patterns currently loaded into CAIRIS, or a GRL model for a selected environment and task; this GRL can be imported into jUCMNav.

Like cimport.py, there is also a command line export script - cexport.py
 
.. code-block:: bash

   ./cexport.py --user=test --database=test_default --type all /tmp/model.xml
