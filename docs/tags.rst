Tags
====

Most objects in CAIRIS can be assigned one or more *tags* to categorise them.  Tags can be used to aid searching, i.e. by searching for objects where the tag has been set.

These tags can be entered in the Tags field in the appropriate form.  Multiple tags can be added by separate individual tags with commas.

Tags can also be used to group objects in risk models.  The example below shows a risk model with a *kill chain*  categorised by `ATT&CK <https://attack.mitre.org>`_ tactic.
